Get started I would suggest look over official documentations for basic installation and configuration. If you cannot solve problem by then, check out blog posts that might be helpful. Docs: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ https://hugoloveit.com/ (this is the LoveIt theme in Hugo, but format\u0026troubleshoot should generalize to other templates) YouTube tutorial step by step Blogs: is-there-a-place-we-can-put-non-blog-files-pdf-files-in-blogdown how-to-make-a-mulilingual-website-with-hugo Misc: Font_Awesome.docset (icons) Common Issues If your page under development mode crashed, be patient and maybe reload the server in terminal with Ctrl-C and hugo server -D Be careful about syntax, format, especially with multilingual setting. If you’re not sure the organization, always refer to the themes/xxx(LoveIt)/exampleSite folder first that’s contained in every Hugo repo after you clone it. When you want to add the featured image for the content preview in the home page, do: resources: - name: \"featured-image\" src: \"featured-image.png\" and name your md file to be index.md. Don’t forget to add the \u003c!--more--\u003e divider if you want to tell Hugo only summarizes the content before divider in preview.

Publish your page Publishing the page is a bit of hassle for me. My sincere suggestion after this experience is to find a tutorial and closely follow the steps.

What does it actually mean to reject the null? Rejecting null doesn’t mean it’s true, it just means we fail to prove it’s false. $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$ are not the opposites. It’s not like one way or the other. Assume null is true, there has happend a low probability event. It seems too rare to happen but if it does happen, then it’s reasonable to suspect the validity of the null.

Hypothesis testing According to Wooldrige’s textbook: there’re two approaches. classical: compare critical value with test statistic, if test statistic \u003e critical value, then reject, because we get a sufficiently large value compared to the null. note as $\\alpha$ significance level decreases, the critical value increases, which means it becomes harder to reject the null and one needs larger test statistic for rejection. For example, if I can reject the null at 5 % significance level, I can surely reject it at 10%. p-value: calculate p-value and compare it to sigficance level, if p-value \u003c significance level, reject the null, vice versa.

Additional thoughts Given the observed value of the t statistic, p value is the smallest significance level (alpha) at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. – Cited from Wooldrige To put it in my own understanding, if p-value is 0.03, it means we would observe test statistic as extreme 3% of time when null is true. Smaller p means stronger evidence against $H_{0}$. To compare it with $\\alpha$ the signficance level is to make sure if we were to reject the null 3% of time, it should be within the tolerance of error(the significance level), say if $\\alpha$ is 0.05, we’re willing to accept mistakenly reject the null 5% of time when it is actually true. Why say p-value is the smallest significance level? if we calculate p to be 0.03 and we can reject the null at 3% significance level, we can certainly reject this at 5% if set by the question.

The task was to preprocess the dataset given and develop best prediction statiscal/ML models possible (“best” means highest accuracy) The dataset came from Kaggle.com, about predicting death due to heart failure based on twelve health characteristics on almost 300 patients (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.). We applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest, with the latter achieving 87% at the end. For model evaluation, we used confusion matrix and ROC curve. Finally, we did an analysis report and presented our findings to professors and other teams (slides).

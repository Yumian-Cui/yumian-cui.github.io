Although it was something I’ve heard of a long time ago, I still decided to give it a try. This time I used Google Sheets as my Pomodoro tracker. I have divided the tracker to 3 sheets, they are (1) Today’s To-Do, (2) Daily Log, and (3) To-Dos (See below images). I would use To-Dos to record my general goals I wanna accomplish either in short run or long run. Then, at the beginning of each day, I pick some tasks I would like to focus on and put those to Today’s To-Do; at the end of each day, I manually enter today’s finished tasks and organize them into Daily Log, which is an extensive table that recorded what I did each date. Today's To-Do\u003cimg src=\"Daily-To-Do.png\" width=\"250\"/\u003e \" Today's To-Do Daily Log\u003cimg src=\"Daily-log.png\" width=\"250\"/\u003e \" Daily Log To-Dos\u003cimg src=\"To-Dos.png\" width=\"250\"/\u003e \" To-Dos After manually transferring information from Today’s To-Do to Daily Log for a while, I got tired of the tedious “copy and paste” process. Thinking it might be a good chance to pick up some new skills, I looked up how to read and write Google Sheets using the elegant gspread API and it turned out to save so much time by just running a short script.

Hypothesis testing According to Wooldrige’s textbook: there’re two approaches. classical: compare critical value with test statistic, if test statistic \u003e critical value, then reject, because we get a sufficiently large value compared to the null. note as $\\alpha$ significance level decreases, the critical value increases, which means it becomes harder to reject the null and one needs larger test statistic for rejection. For example, if I can reject the null at 5 % significance level, I can surely reject it at 10%. p-value: calculate p-value and compare it to sigficance level, if p-value \u003c significance level, reject the null, vice versa.

Additional thoughts Given the observed value of the t statistic, p value is the smallest significance level (alpha) at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. – Cited from Wooldrige To put it in my own understanding, if p-value is 0.03, it means we would observe test statistic as extreme 3% of time when null is true. Smaller p means stronger evidence against $H_{0}$. To compare it with $\\alpha$ the signficance level is to make sure if we were to reject the null 3% of time, it should be within the tolerance of error(the significance level), say if $\\alpha$ is 0.05, we’re willing to accept mistakenly reject the null 5% of time when it is actually true. Why say p-value is the smallest significance level? if we calculate p to be 0.03 and we can reject the null at 3% significance level, we can certainly reject this at 5% if set by the question.

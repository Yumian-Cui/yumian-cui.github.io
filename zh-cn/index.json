What does it actually mean to reject the null? Rejecting null doesn’t mean it’s true, it just means we fail to prove it’s false. $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$ are not the opposites.

Hypothesis testing According to Wooldrige’s textbook: there’re two approaches. classical: compare critical value with test statistic, if test statistic \u003e critical value, then reject, because we get a sufficiently large value compared to the null. note as $\\alpha$ significance level decreases, the critical value increases, which means it becomes harder to reject the null and one needs larger test statistic for rejection. For example, if I can reject the null at 5 % significance level, I can surely reject it at 10%. p-value: calculate p-value and compare it to sigficance level, if p-value \u003c significance level, reject the null, vice versa.

Additional thoughts Given the observed value of the t statistic, p value is the smallest significance level (alpha) at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. – Cited from Wooldrige To put it in my own understanding, if p-value is 0.03, it means we would observe test statistic as extreme 3% of time when null is true. Smaller p means stronger evidence against $H_{0}$. To compare it with $\\alpha$ the signficance level is to make sure if we were to reject the null 3% of time, it should be within the tolerance of error(the significance level), say if $\\alpha$ is 0.05, we’re willing to accept mistakenly reject the null 5% of time when it is actually true. Why say p-value is the smallest significance level? if we calculate p to be 0.03 and we can reject the null at 3% significance level, we can certainly reject this at 5% if set by the question.

The task was to preprocess the dataset given and develop best prediction statiscal/ML models possible (“best” means highest accuracy) The dataset came from Kaggle.com, about predicting death due to heart failure based on twelve health characteristics on almost 300 patients (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.). We applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest, with the latter achieving 87% at the end. For model evaluation, we used confusion matrix and ROC curve. Finally, we did an analysis report and presented our findings to professors and other teams.

# Yumian Cui's Personal Website

This is [Yumian Cui](https://yumian-cui.github.io/about/)'s personal website. It is based on the Hugo theme [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) developed by [Dillon](https://dillonzq.com/).

Thanks to [Ashish Tiwari's shortcodes post](https://ashish.one/gist/add-responsive-google-slides-on-hugo/),[wowchemy-hugo-modules](https://github.com/linozen/wowchemy-hugo-modules), I'm able to incorporate the gdocs shortcodes functionality. In particular, be aware in your shortcodes ```{{</*gdocs src="???"*/>}}```, the ```src``` url should be the one published to web (in your google slides, go to **File** and then **Publish to the web**, select either link or embed and copy the url in src="???"), not the shared url. I corrected this once I found only my laptop web can show gdocs (also the display is not very satisfactory) while ipad and iphone can't. Specifial thanks to [Cecina Babich Morrow's post](https://babichmorrowc.github.io/post/add-google-doc/).

# Yumian Cui's Personal Website

This is [Yumian Cui](https://yumian-cui.github.io/about/)'s personal website. It is based on the Hugo theme [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) developed by [Dillon](https://dillonzq.com/).

Thanks to [Ashish Tiwari's shortcodes post](https://ashish.one/gist/add-responsive-google-slides-on-hugo/) and [wowchemy-hugo-modules](https://github.com/linozen/wowchemy-hugo-modules), I'm able to incorporate the gdocs shortcodes functionality.

What does it actually mean to reject the null? Rejecting null doesn’t mean it’s true, it just means we fail to prove it’s false. $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$ are not the opposites. It’s not like one way or the other. Assume null is true, there has happend a low probability event. It seems too rare to happen but if it does happen, then it’s reasonable to suspect the validity of the null.

Hypothesis testing According to Wooldrige’s textbook: there’re two approaches. classical: compare critical value with test statistic, if test statistic \u003e critical value, then reject, because we get a sufficiently large value compared to the null. note as $\\alpha$ significance level decreases, the critical value increases, which means it becomes harder to reject the null and one needs larger test statistic for rejection. For example, if I can reject the null at 5 % significance level, I can surely reject it at 10%. p-value: calculate p-value and compare it to sigficance level, if p-value \u003c significance level, reject the null, vice versa.

Additional thoughts Given the observed value of the t statistic, p value is the smallest significance level (alpha) at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. – Cited from Wooldrige To put it in my own understanding, if p-value is 0.03, it means we would observe test statistic as extreme 3% of time when null is true. Smaller p means stronger evidence against $H_{0}$. To compare it with $\\alpha$ the signficance level is to make sure if we were to reject the null 3% of time, it should be within the tolerance of error(the significance level), say if $\\alpha$ is 0.05, we’re willing to accept mistakenly reject the null 5% of time when it is actually true. Why say p-value is the smallest significance level? if we calculate p to be 0.03 and we can reject the null at 3% significance level, we can certainly reject this at 5% if set by the question.

We applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest, with the latter achieving 87% at the end. For model evaluation, we used confusion matrix and ROC curve. Finally, we did an analysis report and presented our findings to professors and other teams.

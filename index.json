What I did In Summer 2020, I was fortunate to be selected into the EconEx externship program hosted by Econ department. Mentored by UW-Alumni and Data Scientist Micah Lanier, I completed an independent project analyzing New York City consumer and retail trends under Covid-19. Meanwhile, I self-learnt many useful data analysis techniques in Python, like how to use numpy, pandas, matplotlib … interpolation to fill in missing data and web scraping.
